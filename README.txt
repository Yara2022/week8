I liked this one a lot! Eye movement assignment from week 8. We create two eyes on the screen and the pupils follow the movement of the mouse! Reminded me of Monsters Inc. In the future I was thinking I could create eyes on-click. They will appear all over the screen in different size. If I was REALLY capable as a coder, I can turn it into a game and make objects appear across the screen and the eyes can shoot lasers and destroy the UFO. (sounds like fun actually :P).
